# Awesome Object Capabilities and Capability-based Security

Capability-based security enables the concise composition of powerful
patterns of cooperation without vulnerability.


## Application Hosting

  - [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) is a self-hostable web
    productivity suite and [App Market](https://apps.sandstorm.io/)
    with WordPress, Rocket.Chat, IPython Notebook and many more.
    [Sandstorm's Capability-based Security][scap] protects you and
    your data against application bugs. You can host it yourself, pay
    a few dollars to use Sandstorm Oasis, or deploy it on-premise with
    Sandstorm for Work.

## Libraries and Frameworks

  - [Cap’n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) is an open source
    serialization and RPC protocol with distributed and persistent
    capabilities and promise pipelining.
    - [Cap'n Proto 0.5, and how it is central to Sandstorm][1412]  
      By Kenton Varda - 15 Dec 2014

  - [Secure EcmaScript (SES)](https://github.com/google/caja/wiki/SES)
    is a fail-stop subset of ES5. SES should compatibly run all ES5
    code that follows recognized ES5 best practices. The SES
    restrictions support the writing of defensively consistent
    abstractions -- object abstractions that can defend their
    integrity while being exposed to untrusted but confined objects.

  - [Capper](https://github.com/marcsAtSkyhunter/Capper) is web
    application server with built-in object capability security built
    on Node.js/Express

## Operating Systems

  - [genode](https://genode.org/) is a novel OS architecture that is
    able to master the complexity of code and policy -- the most
    fundamental security problem shared by modern general-purpose
    operating systems -- by applying a strict organizational structure
    to all software components including device drivers, system
    services, and applications.
    - [Genode OS Framework release 16.08][1608] Aug 31, 2016  
      > Genode 16.08 makes the entirety of the framework's drivers,
      > protocol stacks, and libraries available on the seL4 kernel,
      > brings VirtualBox 4 to the Muen separation kernel, and hosts
      > VirtualBox 5 on top of the NOVA kernel. Further highlights are
      > virtual networking and TOR, profound Zynq board support, and
      > tools for statistical profiling.

  - [seL4](https://sel4.systems/) is the world's first
    operating-system kernel with an end-to-end proof of implementation
    correctness and security enforcement; it is available as open
    source.

## Programming Languages

  - [Pony](http://www.ponylang.org/) is an open-source,
    object-oriented, actor-model, capabilities-secure, high
    performance programming language.

      S. Clebsch and S. Drossopoulou  
      OOPSLA 2013

  - [Monte](http://www.monte-language.org/) is a nascent dynamic
    programming language reminiscent of Python and E. It is based upon
    _The Principle of Least Authority_ (POLA), which governs
    interactions between objects, and a _capability-based object
    model_, which grants certain essential safety guarantees to all
    objects.

    > When separately written programs are composed so that they may
    > cooperate, they may instead destructively interfere in
    > unanticipated ways. These hazards limit the scale and
    > functionality of the software systems we can successfully
    > compose. This dissertation presents a framework for enabling
    > those interactions between components needed for the cooperation
    > we intend, while minimizing the hazards of destructive
    > interference.

    > Great progress on the composition problem has been

    > sequential, single-machine programming among benign

    > Every novel cooperative arrangement of mutually suspicious parties
    > interacting electronically — every smart contract — effectively requires a new
    > cryptographic protocol. However, if every new contract requires new
    > cryptographic protocol design, our dreams of cryptographically enabled
    > electronic commerce would be unreachable. Cryptographic protocol design is
    > too hard and expensive, given our unlimited need for new contracts.
    > Just as the digital logic gate abstraction allows digital circuit designers to create large analog circuits without doing analog circuit design, we present
    > cryptographic capabilities as an abstraction allowing a similar economy of
    > engineering effort in creating smart contracts. We explain the E system, which
    > embodies these principles, and show a covered-call-option as a smart contract
    > written in a simple security formalism independent of cryptography, but
    > automatically implemented as a cryptographic protocol coordinating five
    > mutually suspicious parties
