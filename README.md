# Awesome Object Capabilities and Capability-based Security

Capability-based security enables the concise composition of powerful
patterns of cooperation without vulnerability.


## Application Hosting

  - [Sandstorm](https://sandstorm.io/) is a self-hostable web
    productivity suite and [App Market](https://apps.sandstorm.io/)
    with WordPress, Rocket.Chat, IPython Notebook and many more.
    [Sandstorm's Capability-based Security][scap] protects you and
    your data against application bugs. You can host it yourself, pay
    a few dollars to use Sandstorm Oasis, or deploy it on-premise with
    Sandstorm for Work.

## Libraries and Frameworks

  - [Caja](https://developers.google.com/caja/) is a compiler for making
    third-party HTML, CSS and JavaScript safe for embedding.
    Caja safely supports mashups and extends JSON with code.
    - 12 Jan 2017: release v6011 74ba0da
 
  - [Cap’n Proto](https://capnproto.org/) is an open source
    serialization and RPC protocol with distributed and persistent
    capabilities and promise pipelining.

      By Kenton Varda - 15 Dec 2014

  - [Secure EcmaScript (SES)](https://github.com/google/caja/wiki/SES)
    is a fail-stop subset of ES5. SES should compatibly run all ES5
    code that follows recognized ES5 best practices. The SES
    restrictions support the writing of defensively consistent
    abstractions -- object abstractions that can defend their
    integrity while being exposed to untrusted but confined objects.

  - [Capper](https://github.com/marcsAtSkyhunter/Capper) is web
    application server with built-in object capability security built
    on Node.js/Express
    
  - [Network protocols, sans I/O](http://sans-io.readthedocs.io/) supports
    object capability discipline by letting the caller handle network access.

  - [Shill](http://shill-lang.org): Shill is a shell scripting
    language designed to make it easy to follow the Principle of Least
    Privilege. It runs on FreeBSD and is developed in Racket.

      (OSDI), October 2014.

  - [CloudABI](https://nuxi.nl/) is a runtime environment for
    Unix-like systems that introduces dependency injection to full
    Unix applications. Instead of allowing applications to open
    arbitrary files on disk and connect to arbitrary systems on the
    network, you as a user exactly inject those resources that the
    application should access.

## Operating Systems

  - [Capsicum](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/capsicum/)
    Capsicum is a lightweight OS capability and sandbox framework that
    extends the POSIX API, providing several new OS primitives to
    support object-capability security on UNIX-like operating systems

      Blue Touchpaper, 20 December, 2013. Robert Watson reviews
      Capsicum events from 2013: work funded by the FreeBSD Foundation
      and Google on FreeBSD 10.0, Casper in FreeBSD 11, David
      Drysdale's port of Capsicum to Linux at Google, Summer of Code
      students, joint work with the University of Wisconsin on
      Capsicum, and future funded Capsicum work.

  - [genode](https://genode.org/) is a novel OS architecture that is
    able to master the complexity of code and policy -- the most
    fundamental security problem shared by modern general-purpose
    operating systems -- by applying a strict organizational structure
    to all software components including device drivers, system
    services, and applications.
    - [Genode OS Framework release 16.08][1608] Aug 31, 2016  
      > Genode 16.08 makes the entirety of the framework's drivers,
      > protocol stacks, and libraries available on the seL4 kernel,
      > brings VirtualBox 4 to the Muen separation kernel, and hosts
      > VirtualBox 5 on top of the NOVA kernel. Further highlights are
      > virtual networking and TOR, profound Zynq board support, and
      > tools for statistical profiling.

  - [seL4](https://sel4.systems/) is the world's first
    operating-system kernel with an end-to-end proof of implementation
    correctness and security enforcement; it is available as open
    source.

  - [Barrelfish](http://www.barrelfish.org/) is a research operating
    system motivated by two closely related trends in hardware design:
    the rapidly growing number of cores and the increasing diversity
    in computer hardware. Barrelfish uses a single model of
    capabilities to control access to all physical memory, kernel
    objects, communication end-points, and other miscellaneous access
    rights.

  - [Monte](http://www.monte-language.org/) is a nascent dynamic
    programming language reminiscent of Python and E. It is based upon
    _The Principle of Least Authority_ (POLA), which governs
    interactions between objects, and a _capability-based object
    model_, which grants certain essential safety guarantees to all
    objects.


## CPUs

  - [CHERI](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/) is an open source capability CPU design.

    > When separately written programs are composed so that they may
    > cooperate, they may instead destructively interfere in
    > unanticipated ways. These hazards limit the scale and
    > functionality of the software systems we can successfully
    > compose. This dissertation presents a framework for enabling
    > those interactions between components needed for the cooperation
    > we intend, while minimizing the hazards of destructive
    > interference.

    > Great progress on the composition problem has been
    > made within the object paradigm, chiefly in the context of
    > sequential, single-machine programming among benign
    > components. We show how to extend this success to support robust
    > composition of concurrent and potentially malicious components
    > distributed over potentially malicious machines. We present E, a
    > distributed, persistent, secure programming language, and
    > CapDesk, a virus-safe desktop built in E, as embodiments of the
    > techniques we explain.
